# Manokara

Public browser karaoke and OBS lyrics with Folia and JIZURA visualizers. Anyone can open the app without an account or password. The Python backend creates private browser rooms and revocable read-only OBS links, so different users can broadcast different songs simultaneously.

Deploy on an Arch Linux VPS using the short [deployment guide](DEPLOY.md): install the Python requirements, set your hostname in `start-manokara.sh`, and run it as your normal user. Python serves both the frontend and relay on `127.0.0.1:8000`; you manage the tunnel and cron yourself.

Requires Python 3.12 or newer and an explicit origin. Setlists and preferences stay in the browser; room identities and anonymous browser credentials are stored in `$HOME/.local/state/manokara` by default. Caddy is not required.

Run security regression tests with `python -m pytest tests/test_security.py`. See the deployment guide for local development and the Chromium smoke test.

Shared lyric parsing and timing live in `outputs/manokara-core.js`; all visualizers consume the same timeline. Use `node --test tests/test_core.cjs` for clock/parser regressions and `python tests/browser_smoke.py --all-effects` for the controller and every output mode.
